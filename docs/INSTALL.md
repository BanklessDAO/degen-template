-   [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - easily change node versions
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - dependency management system
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) - for local development
-   [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) - enhanced terminal for macOS
-   [discord](https://discord.com/) - popular chat application used for gaming and organized communities
